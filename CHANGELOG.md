# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `vcs-url` and `expected-sha256` inputs on the action to select which
  `msaccess-vcs-addin` release is used to build Access databases. Defaults to the
  public v5.0.1 release, so existing callers are unaffected; override them to
  consume a custom or pre-release add-in build.

### Fixed
- Aligned the internal `msaccess-vcs-build-all` subaction reference so add-in URL
  overrides take effect on the current branch.
