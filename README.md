# VBA-Build

For a demo on how to use this GitHub Action: [VBA-Build-Demo](https://github.com/DecimalTurn/VBA-Build-Demo)

## How does it work?

This GitHub Action automates the process of building VBA-Enabled Office documents from XML[^1] and VBA source code:

Before running this action, initialize the runner with [setup-vba](https://github.com/DecimalTurn/setup-vba).

The main script is contained in `Main.ps1` and will perform the following actions:

- Install 7-Zip for handling file compression
- Create Office file from XML source:
    - Find the XML source files representing your Office document structure
    - Compress them into a zip file using 7-Zip
    - Rename the zip file with the appropriate Office extension (e.g., .xlsm)
- Import the VBA components:
    - Enable the Visual Basic Object Model (VBOM) and general macro permissions in the registry of the Windows GitHub Worker
    - Opens the Office file and imports all modules (.bas), Forms (.frm) and Class Modules (.cls) from your source directory
- Run tests:
    - If a testing framework was specified, install the required dependencies
    - Run the tests and output the results to the console
- Generate final output:
    - Save the final document with embedded VBA code
    - Upload the resulting documents as build artifacts

## Supported File Formats

* Excel (.xlsm, .xlam and .xlsb)
* Word (.docm)
* PowerPoint (.pptm, .ppam)
* Access[^2] (.accdb, .accde)

## Why? 

I mean, why not? Every other programming language has something like this to build and package your code.

This could be used to:

- Keep your VBA code in plain text format for version control
- Automate builds as part of your CI/CD pipeline
- Generate ready-to-use Office documents without manual intervention

## What's next?

Depending on the reaction of the community, I might add support for:
- Allow unit tests to run on Microsoft Access files
- More complex file structure using [vbaproject.toml](https://github.com/vbapm/core/blob/main/README.md#manifest-vbaprojecttoml) configuration file (manifest file)
- Signature of the VBA Project (to facilitate distribution)

[^1]: All modern Office file formats for Word, PowerPoint and Excel are actually .zip files in disguse. Access is an exception in this case since the content of an Access Database (.accdb) is different and in order to do version control you'd have to use a tool like [msaccess-vcs-addin](https://github.com/joyfullservice/msaccess-vcs-addin). 
[^2]: For Access, this GitHub Action makes use of msaccess-vcs-addin via [msaccess-vcs-build](https://github.com/AccessCodeLib/msaccess-vcs-build) meaning that you need to use the addin in Access to create the source material for the build.
